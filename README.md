**Persequor Dev Test**

Scope: 
+ No need to implement interfaces. Implement only the `TODO` comments as you see fit.
+ You can change anything you like. Frameworks, patterns, interfaces etc.
+ We suggest to work on it between 0.5 to 2 hours, but feel free to use as much time as you need.
+ Commit as often as you see fit.
+ There is no requirement to finish this, just to have some code for evaluation and further talks. Ensure that you also add unit tests for your work.
+ Review the code in the com.persequor.extensions package, including the tests.
